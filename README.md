# README #

We are aiming to determine the area of several land use type defined by [EXIOBASE](https://www.exiobase.eu/) using only data available from [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data).
This can be done as a 4 steps process as illustrated by the diagram below. Each step is refering to a folder containing all the modules needed to complete the step.

![flow.png](readme_pictures/flow.png)


The whole process is described in details [here](Method.md)

The main script **run_all.py** follows the 4 steps described in the diagram.

DATAFOLDER is the location where one can find all files we download from FAOSTAT but also all final tables we  generate through the whole process. 

```python
DATAFOLDER: Path = Path('/home/candyd/tmp/FAO')
```

Inside this folder one can found 3 repositories:

- **download** : which contains the 3 .zip files directly downloaded from FAO

- **data** : which contains all the tables contained in the 3 zip files mentionned above.

- **final_tables** : which contains 8 files.
    
# Download the data #
The folder **Download** contains the script **main.py** which allows us to download the 3 tables needed.
- [Land Use](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL) contains data on forty-four categories of land use, irrigation and agricultural practices and five indicators relevant to monitor agriculture, forestry and fisheries activities at national, regional and global level. Data are available by country and year, with global coverage and annual updates.

- [Land Cover](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/LC) under the Agri-Environmental Indicators section contains land cover information organized by the land cover classes of the international standard system for Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA CF).
- [Crop and livestock products](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL) covering the following categories: crops primery, crops processed, live animals, livestock primary, livestock processed

> [!IMPORTANT]
>It is important to note that when it comes to land use, multiple-cropped areas are counted only once. Please visit [FAOSTAT webpage related on land use](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL). First click on **Definitions and standards - Land Use**, then on **item**.
Look for the description of item code 6630.


# Process raw data #

Following this process where we deal with missing data with assumption, linear interpolation and regression, 6 tables are created and stored in **final_tables** mentioned in previous section.
This tables consist of :

- *landuse_final_runnall.csv*. 

    This table contains all items from the land use table and item 6970, Artificial surfaces (including urban and associated areas) from the land cover table. All areas (in **km<sup>2</sup>** ) are available, unless specified in this [file](aux_data/parameters.yaml), from 1961 to 2021.

- *final_crops_primary.csv*. 

    This table contains the crops primary items from the crop and livestock products table. These include : Cereals, Citrus Fruit, Fibre Crops, Fruit, Oil Crops, Oil Crops and Cakes in Oil Equivalent, Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Sugar Crops, Treenuts and Vegetables. Data are expressed in terms of area harvested (in **km<sup>2</sup>**),  production quantity (in **tonnes**) and yield. 
    
    Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. All areas and production quantities are available, unless specified in this [file](aux_data/parameters.yaml), from 1961 to 2021.
